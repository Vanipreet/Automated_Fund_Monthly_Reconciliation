# Fund_Monthly_Reconciliation

The purpose of [Fund_Monthly_Reconciliation_Macro.xlsm](https://github.com/Vanipreet/Automated_Fund_Monthly_Reconciliation/blob/master/Fund_Monthly_Reconciliation/Fund_Monthly_Reconciliation_Macro.xlsm) is to create an automated process for the execution of Portfolio's / Fund's Monthly Reconciliation. There are multiple assumptions and pre-requisites that has been kept in place for the smooth execution of this macro.

# Assumptions
This macro is built with few assumptions in mind as listed below

1. For the macro to run, we need two external data inputs, Monthly Bank_statement and Monthly Broker_statement
2. The macro is prepared for the purpose of Monthly Reconciliation and hence uses monthly reconciliation files
3. Macro and the data inputs are available under "H:\Fund_Monthly_Reconciliation" directory, however as per the drive parition, this can be amended
5. Macro expects static input data. However with appropriate mapping, database can be also accurated utilized
